# Orfeu
*Named after the Brasilian pronouniciation of Orfeus, the Greek God of music.*     

While Spotify's recommendation algorithm is powerful, it focuses on music similarity, often feeding you a playlist regurgitation of genres you already know. It doesn't take risks and it focuses on marketing music instead of educating about music. Orfeu aims to break this cycle by introducing listeners to a broader scope of genres along with their historical and cultural importance. 

## Methodology

The data was collected by scraping **everynoise.com** using web-scraping libraries **BeautifulSoup** and **Scrapy**. This data includes an extensive list of (>6000) genres, compared to the 126 that Spotify API provides, classified using ML into three distinct playlist types.  

- **The Sound**: A collection representing the general sound of the genre.
- **The Pulse**: Core songs beloved by the main listener demographic.
- **The Edge**: Tracks that represent the more experimental aspects of the genre.

A natural language processing model **SpaCy** was used to identify locations and separate playlists into geographic regions. This can be explored on subpage /locations

## How to Use

Visit the Orfeu website to discover a new genre each day. The site features:

- A randomly selected genre.
- A link to a Spotify playlist curated to explore the genre.
- Key descriptive points about the genre, web scraped from Wikipedia.

*I encourage users to listen to a few songs from different artists within the genre and perform a simple Google search to learn more about its cultural context.*

## Future wORK
plan to add features:

- Lists of the most popular artists and songs within each genre.
- Insights into the genreâ€™s influence on others.
- Detailed explanations of the rhythms, instruments, and cultural ties that define the genre.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy
- **Data Cleaning**: Python (pandas, numpy)
- **Visualizations**: D3.js
- **Music Data**: Spotify API
- **Geographical Data**: Google Maps API
